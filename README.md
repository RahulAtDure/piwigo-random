Piwigo RANDOM
=============

Piwigo-random is a simple solution to incorporate random images from a
[Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/) galery in any website.

It uses Piwigo's [remote API](http://piwigo.org/demo/tools/ws.htm), so
it does not need anything installed on the Piwigo server. It consists
in 2 parts:

* A small PHP script, piwigo-random-js.php that should be placed on
  any webserver able to execute PHP.

* An HTML snippet, to be inserted in any webpage where you wish to
  include images.
